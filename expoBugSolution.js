The solution involves a multi-step debugging process:

1. **Examine the Expo Build Logs:** Carefully analyze the complete build logs. Look for specific errors, warnings, or hints about the cause.
2. **Check Dependencies:** Verify that all project dependencies are compatible with the Expo SDK version. Use `npm ls` or `yarn why` to check dependency trees.  Look for version conflicts or unmet peer dependencies.
3. **Review `app.json` / `expo.json`:** Check for any misconfigurations, typos, or incorrect settings in the project configuration files.  Ensure that the settings are appropriate for your target platform.
4. **Clean and Rebuild:** Try cleaning the project cache and rebuilding. This can sometimes resolve transient issues.
5. **Update/Downgrade Dependencies:** Try updating or downgrading specific packages that might be causing conflicts. Often, a minor version change can solve the problem. If updating makes it worse, try an older version.
6. **Simplify the Project:** If the problem persists, try creating a minimal reproducible example to isolate the issue. Create a new project with only the essential components that still result in the error.
