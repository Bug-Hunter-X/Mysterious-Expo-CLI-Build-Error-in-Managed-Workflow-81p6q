# Mysterious Expo CLI Build Error

This repository demonstrates an uncommon build error encountered when using the Expo CLI with a managed workflow. The error itself is often vague, making debugging challenging.

## Problem

The project fails to build using `expo build:ios` or `expo build:android`, producing cryptic error messages that don't directly point to the root cause. The logs might show general failures or compilation problems without clear guidance.

## Solution

The solution involves meticulously checking dependencies and configurations. This includes verifying compatibility between the Expo SDK version and installed packages, reviewing `app.json`/`expo.json` for potential issues, and carefully examining the Expo build logs for subtle clues. Sometimes, downgrading or updating specific packages can resolve the problem.
