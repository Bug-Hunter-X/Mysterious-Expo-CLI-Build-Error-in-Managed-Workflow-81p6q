This error occurs when using Expo CLI and involves issues with the managed workflow, specifically related to the build process.  The error message itself might not be very descriptive, often pointing to general issues or failing to pinpoint the exact problem.  Debugging this requires careful examination of the Expo build logs, checking the project's dependencies, and inspecting the configuration files (like `app.json` or `expo.json`).  One common underlying cause is incompatibility between Expo's SDK version and the project's dependencies, leading to build failures.
